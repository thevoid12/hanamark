# This is Void
## Judge Me by the Code, Not Words.
#### This website is all about:
- All the cute, tiny tools I build
- My markdown tech blogs
- A one-stop collection of my readlist (blogs and videos I find interesting, books I read)
**Won't have any CSS coz I don't want to be yet another guy who generates CSS from LLMs. XD**
  - [My so-called blog](./blog/blogs.html)
  - [My projects](./projects/projects.html)
  - [My Interesting Reads](./readlogs/readlog.html)
  - [Watch logs](./watchlog/watchlog.html)
